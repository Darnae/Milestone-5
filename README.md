# Milestone-5
Final Inventory Manager


This Assignment's purpose was to simply refine the last project I had completed. All I had to do was make at least one refinement, it did not have be major. So I simply added an extra button event that allowed for second form to travel back to the first form. Aside from listing the change I made in this readme no futhter changes were needed.

I displayed the change in the screencast.
